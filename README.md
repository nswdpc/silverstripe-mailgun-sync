# Silverstripe Mailgun Mailer, Messaging and Webhook handling

This module provides functionality to send emails via the Mailgun API and store events related to messages using Mailgun's webhooks feature

## Requirements

See [composer.json](./composer.json)

+ silverstripe/framework ^4
+ Symbiote's [Queued Jobs](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs) module
+ Mailgun PHP SDK ^3, kriswallsmith/buzz, nyholm/psr7

### Mailgun configuration

You need:

* A Mailgun account
* At least one non-sandbox Mailgun mailing domain ([verified is best](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#verifying-your-domain)) in your choice of region
* A Mailgun API key or a [Mailgun Domain Sending Key](https://www.mailgun.com/blog/mailgun-ip-pools-domain-keys) for the relevant mailing domain (the latter is recommended)
* MailgunEmail and MailgunMailer configured in your project (see below)

## Installing

```shell
composer require nswdpc/silverstripe-mailgun-sync
```

## Configuration

### Mailgun account

Configuration of your Mailgun domain and account is beyond the scope of this document but is straightforward.

You should verify your domain to avoid message delivery issues. The best starting point is [Verifying a Domain](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#verifying-your-domain).

MXToolBox.com is a useful tool to check your mailing domain has valid DMARC records.

### Module

Add the following to your project's yaml config:
```yml
---
Name: local-mailgunsync-config
After:
  - '#mailgunsync'
---
# API config
NSWDPC\Messaging\Mailgun\Connector\Base:
  # your Mailgun mailing domain
  api_domain: 'configured.mailgun.domain'
  # your API key or Domain Sending Key
  api_key: 'xxxx'
  # the endpoint region, if you use EU set this value to 'API_ENDPOINT_EU'
  # for the default region, leave empty
  api_endpoint_region: ''
  # this setting triggers o:testmode='yes' in messages
  api_testmode: true|false
  # You will probably want this as true, when false some clients will show 'Sent on behalf of' text
  always_set_sender: true
  # set this to override the From header, this is useful if your application sends out mail from anyone (see DMARC below)
  always_from: 'someone@example.com'
  # Whether to send via a job - see below
  send_via_job: 'yes|no|when-attachments'
  # When set, messages with no 'To' header are delivered here.
  default_recipient: ''
  # grab this from your Mailgun account control panel
  webhook_signing_key: ''
  # whether you want to store webhook requests
  webhooks_enabled: true|false
  # the current or new filter variable (see webhooks documentation in ./docs)
  webhook_filter_variable: ''
  # the previous one, to allow variable rotation
  webhook_previous_filter_variable: ''
---
# Configure the mailer
Name: local-mailer
After:
  # Override core email configuration
  - '#emailconfig'
  # replace TaggableEmail with MailgunEmail
  - '#nswdpc-taggable-email'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email:
    class: 'NSWDPC\Messaging\Mailgun\MailgunEmail'
  SilverStripe\Control\Email\Mailer:
    class: 'NSWDPC\Messaging\Mailgun\MailgunMailer'
```

> Remember to flush configuration after a configuration change.

See [detailed configuration, including project tags](./docs/en/005-detailed_configuration.md)

## Sending

### Mailer

For a good example of this, look at the MailgunSyncTest class. Messages are sent using the default Silverstripe Email API:

```php
use SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email;

$email = Email::create();
$email->setFrom($from);
$email->setTo($to);
$email->setSubject($subject);
```
To add custom parameters used by Mailgun you call setCustomParameters():
```php

// variables
$variables = [
    'test' => 'true',
    'foo' => 'bar',
];

//options
$options = [
    'testmode' => 'yes',
    'tag' => ['tag1','tag2','tag4'],
    'tracking' => 'yes',
    'require-tls' => 'yes'
];

// headers
$headers = [
    'X-Test-Header' => 'testing'
];

$recipient_variables = [
    'someone@example.com' => ["unique_id" => "testing_123"]
];

$args = [
    'options' => $options,
    'variables' => $variables,
    'headers' => $headers,
    'recipient-variables' => $recipient_variables
];

$email->setCustomParameters($args)
```
Where `$args` is an array of [your custom parameters](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-sending.html#sending). Calling setCustomParameters() multiple times will overwrite previous parameters.

Send the message:
```php
$response = $email->send();
```

The response will either be a Mailgun message-id OR a `Symbiote\QueuedJobs\DataObjects\QueuedJobDescriptor` instance if you are sending via the queued job.

### Via API connector

You can send directly via the API connector, which handles client setup and the like based on configuration.
For a good example of this, look at the MailgunMailer class

```php
use NSWDPC\Messaging\Mailgun\Connector\Message;

//set parameters
$parameters = [
    'to' => ...,
    'from' => ...,
    'o:tag' => ['tag1','tag2']
    // etc
];
$connector = Message::create();
$response = $connector->send($parameters);
```
The response will either be a Mailgun message-id OR a `Symbiote\QueuedJobs\DataObjects\QueuedJobDescriptor` instance if you are sending via the queued job.

### Direct to Mailgun PHP SDK

If you like, you can send messages and interact with the Mailgun API via the Mailgun PHP SDK:

```php
use Mailgun\Mailgun;

$client = Mailgun::create($api_key);
// set things up then send
$response = $client->messages()->send($domain, $parameters);
```

The response will be a `Mailgun\Model\Message\SendResponse` instance if successful.

See the [Mailgun PHP SDK documentation](https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun-php) for examples.

## Queued Jobs

The module uses the [Queued Jobs](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs) module to deliver email at a later time.

This way, a website request that involves delivering an email will not be held up by API issues.

### SendJob

This is a queued job that can be used to send emails depending on the ```send_via_job``` config value -
+ 'yes' - all the time
+ 'when-attachments' - only when attachments are present, or
+ 'no' - never (in which case messages will never send via a Queued Job)

Messages are handed off to this queued job, which is configured to send after one minute. Once delivered, the message parameters are cleared to reduce space used by large messages.

This job is marked as 'broken' immediately upon an API or other general error. Please read the Queued Jobs Health Check documentation to get assistance with Broken job reporting.

### TruncateJob

Use this job to clear out older MailgunEvent webhook records. If you don't use webhooks to store events, this job can remain unused.

### RequeueJob

Use this job to kick broken SendJob instances, which happen from time-to-time due to API or connectivity issues.

This job will:
1. Take all job descriptor records for SendJob that are Broken
1. Reset their status, processing counts and worker value to default initial values
1. Set them to start after a minute
1. Save the record

On the next queue run, these jobs will attempt to send again.

## Manual Resubmission

Messages can be resent from the Mailgun control panel. This depends on your Message Retention setting for the relevant mailing domain in Mailgun.

## DMARC considerations

When sending email it's wise to consider how you maintain the quality of your mailing domain (and IP(s)).

If your mailing domain is "mg.example.com" and you send "From: someone@example.net" DMARC rules will most likely kick in at the recipient mail server and your message will be quarantined or rejected (unless example.net designates example.com as a permitted sender).  Instead, use a From header of "someone@mg.example.com" or "someone@example.com" in your messages.

Your Reply-To header can be any valid address.

See [dmarc.org](https://dmarc.org) for more information on the importance of DMARC, SPF and DKIM


## Tests

Unit tests: [./tests](./tests). Tests use the [TestMessage](./tests/TestMessage.php) connector.

### Sending emails using sandbox/testmode

For acceptance testing, you can use a combination of the Mailgun sandbox domain and API testmode.

+ Sandbox domain: set the `api_domain` value in configuration to the sandbox domain provided by Mailgun. Remember to list approved recipients in the sandbox domain settings in the Mailgun control panel.
+ Test mode: set the `api_testmode` value to true. In testmode, Mailgun accepts but does not deliver messages.

## Breaking changes in 1.0 release

Version 1 removed unused features to reduce the complexity of this module.

The core functionality is now:

+ Send messages via the standard Email process in Silverstripe, with added Mailgun options
+ Send messages directly via the API
+ Handle webhook requests from Mailgun via a dedicated controller

Synchronisation of events is now handled by the [webhooks controller](./docs/en/100-webhooks.md)
